This repository is for me to test out the smoothness of new Windows laptops  and the browser and check out RAM usage.
So, on any web Browser I can go to my Github profile page which I remember and I can go into this repo and clone this script.
I used Python3 and Selenium WebDriver for Automating the task. And I also used the "time" module to calculate the time taken to complete the task.
I have also included a powershell_cmd.txt file that contains the shortcuts and the URL to get the necessary tools to run the python script.
You are free to use it but I should also warn you to use this only if you have proper knowledge of what you are doing.
Also use the actual path of python3 and webdriver on that PC.
Thanks.
